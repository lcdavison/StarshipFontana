# Starship Fontana #

This is an example C++ application using the SDL2 library.

## Installation ##
On Fedora (64bit) you can install the SDL2 library as follows:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install SDL2-devel.x86_64 SDL2_image-devel.x86_64 SDL2.x86_64 SDL2_image.x86_64
```

The easiest way to compile is to use a command-line
(tested using g++ (GCC) 6.3.1 20161221 (Red Hat 6.3.1-1))

## FEDORA ##

```bash
$ make fedora
```
## RASPBIAN ##

```bash
$ make raspbian
```
## STARTING GAME ##

After running the relevant makefile, an executable file called "starship" will be produced in the
top-level directory.  To execute this file do the following

`$ ./starship`
 
from the top-level directory.  The game will expect to find the
`assets` directory under its current working directory.
